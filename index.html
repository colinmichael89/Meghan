        Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Meghan Powell and I LOVE to run. At the beginning of 2022, I decided to start taking my passion for running to the next level by working hard to increase the amount, distance and speed I run every week. I am planning on doing my first official half-marathon this year and my first full marathon in 2023 (once I finish my Nursing program at Denver School of Nursing). If you are interested in running at all or looking for some motivation, follow along with me and let's <span class="run">run together!</span>
